3. **Scenario: Number Comparison**
   - **Problem**: Write a program that takes three integers and determines the largest of the three using multiple `else if` statements.
   - **Input**: 
     - `a = 10`, `b = 15`, `c = 12`
   - **Output**: 
     - Largest Number: `15`

4. **Scenario: Loan Approval System**
   - **Problem**: Create a loan approval program where the eligibility for a loan is based on credit score:
     - Credit Score >= 750: High Priority Approval
     - Credit Score >= 600 and < 750: Medium Priority Approval
     - Credit Score < 600: Low Priority or Denied
   - **Input**: 
     - Credit Score: `670`
   - **Output**: 
     - Loan Approval: `Medium Priority Approval`

5. **Scenario: Temperature Evaluation**
   - **Problem**: Write a program that takes the temperature as input and outputs:
     - Temperature <= 0: Freezing
     - Temperature > 0 and <= 15: Cold
     - Temperature > 15 and <= 30: Warm
     - Temperature > 30: Hot
   - **Input**: 
     - Temperature: `18`
   - **Output**: 
     - Temperature Status: `Warm`

### **Short Hand If Else Questions:**

6. **Scenario: Parity Check**
   - **Problem**: Write a C++ program that takes an integer as input and checks if the number is even or odd using the shorthand `if else` statement.
   - **Input**: 
     - Number: `7`
   - **Output**: 
     - `Odd`

7. **Scenario: Voting Eligibility**
   - **Problem**: Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on age (18 or above). Use shorthand `if else` for the output message:
     - Eligible to vote
     - Not eligible to vote
   - **Input**: 
     - Age: `20`
   - **Output**: 
     - `Eligible to vote`

8. **Scenario: Positive or Negative**
   - **Problem**: Write a program that takes an integer input and prints whether the number is positive or negative using shorthand `if else`.
   - **Input**: 
     - Number: `-5`
   - **Output**: 
     - `Negative`

9. **Scenario: Check Divisibility**
   - **Problem**: Create a program that checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using shorthand `if else`.
   - **Input**: 
     - Number: `15`
   - **Output**: 
     - `Divisible by both 3 and 5`

10. **Scenario: Find Maximum of Two Numbers**
    - **Problem**: Write a program that takes two integers and outputs the larger number using shorthand `if else`.
    - **Input**: 
      - `a = 10`, `b = 20`
    - **Output**: 
      - `Maximum Number: 20`

### **Switch Case Questions:**

1. **Scenario: Weekday Finder**
   - **Problem**: Write a program that takes an integer from 1 to 7 as input and outputs the corresponding day of the week using a `switch` case (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.).
   - **Input**: 
     - Day Number: `3`
   - **Output**: 
     - Day: `Wednesday`

2. **Scenario: Simple Calculator**
   - **Problem**: Create a simple calculator that takes two integers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and performs the corresponding operation using a `switch` case.
   - **Input**: 
     - First Number: `5`
     - Second Number: `3`
     - Operator: `+`
   - **Output**: 
     - Result: `8`

3. **Scenario: Menu Selection**
   - **Problem**: Write a program that presents a menu with the following options:
     - 1. Coffee

   - **Input**: 
     - Grade: `B`
   - **Output**: 
     - Grade Message: `Good`

5. **Scenario: Days in a Month**
   - **Problem**: Write a program that takes a month number (1-12) as input and prints the number of days in that month using a `switch` case (handle leap year for February).
   - **Input**: 
     - Month: `2` (February)
   - **Output**: 
     - Days in February: `28` (assuming it's not a leap year)

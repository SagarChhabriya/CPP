20. **Write a program that uses a `bool` variable to check if a number is greater than 10.**

25. **Write a program that declares an array of 5 integers. Initialize the array with values and find the sum of all elements.**

29. **Create a program that checks if a number is even or odd using a `bool` variable and the modulus operator.**

31. **Write a program that defines two constant variables: one for the speed of light and another for the gravitational constant. Calculate the time it takes for light to travel a distance (given a distance as input).**


32. **Write a program to find the smallest number from a set of 5 numbers entered by the user.**


33. **Create a program that defines a constant for the maximum number of students in a class. Initialize a variable to store the current number of students, and display a message if the number exceeds the maximum.**

34. **Write a program that declares a `char` variable and stores a character from the user. Print the ASCII value of the character.**


36. **Write a program that uses a `bool` variable to check whether a year is a leap year.**  
    Use the following logic:
    - If a year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it’s a leap year.
    - If a year is divisible by 400, it’s a leap year.

37. **Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.**

11. **Write a program that declares an integer variable `num` and prints its value.**

12. **Write a program that calculates and prints the perimeter of a rectangle.**  
    Assume the length is 10 and the width is 5.

13. **What happens if you try to change the value of a constant variable?**  
    Write a program that demonstrates this.

14. **Create a program that uses a `string` variable to store your name and prints it.**

15. **Given the following data, write a program to calculate the total fee of a student:**

### Code

20. **Write a program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle.**  
    Use the formula `Area = π * radius^2` and `Circumference = 2 * π * radius`.  
    Assume `radius = 7`.

21. **Create a program that accepts two integer inputs from the user, adds them, and displays the sum.**

22. **Write a program that calculates and prints the average of three numbers using `double` variables.**  
    Accept the numbers as inputs from the user.

23. **Create a program to calculate the volume of a cylinder.**  
    Formula: `Volume = π * radius^2 * height`. Assume `radius = 5` and `height = 10`.

24. **Write a program that uses a `const` variable to store the value of `PI`. Use this constant to calculate the area of a circle given a radius from the user.**

25. **Write a program that calculates the Simple Interest using the formula: `Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100`. Assume `Principal = 1000`, `Rate = 5`, and `Time = 3`.

26. **Write a program to convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.**  
    Formula: `Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`

27. **Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle, square, and triangle.**  
    - For rectangle: `Area = length * width`
    - For square: `Area = side * side`
    - For triangle: `Area = 0.5 * base * height`

28. **Write a program that declares a `char` variable and stores a character from the user. Print the ASCII value of the character.**

29. **Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.**

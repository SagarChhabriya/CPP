14. **How would you store the number `3.14159` in C++?**
15. **Write a program that declares an integer variable `age` and assigns the value `25` to it. Output the value of `age`.**
16. **Write a program that declares a string variable `name` and initializes it with `"Alice"`. Then, output the value of `name`.**
17. **How would you declare a `char` variable and assign it the value `'X'`?**
18. **What is the range of values an `int` data type can store?**
19. **If you declare a variable as `double` and assign it a value `9.87654321`, how many decimal places will be stored in the variable?**
20. **Write a program that declares a `bool` variable `isAdult` and assigns `true` to it. Output the value of `isAdult`.**

## Hard Exercises

21. **What would be the output of the following code?**
    ```cpp
    int x = 5;
    double y = 2.5;
    double result = x * y;
    cout << result;
    ```
22. **Write a program to calculate the total cost of 50 items, where each item costs `12.99`. Use appropriate data types.**
23. **Explain how you would use `e` notation (scientific notation) for a floating-point number in C++.**
24. **Write a program that uses a `bool` variable to check whether a number is positive.**
25. **What happens if you try to store a decimal value like `3.14` in an `int` variable? Explain with an example.**
26. **Explain the concept of precision in `float` and `double`. Why would you choose `double` over `float` in most cases?**
27. **Write a program that uses `float` to store a scientific number `1.2e3` and outputs the result.**
28. **Write a program that stores a character as an ASCII value and prints the corresponding character (for example, storing `65` and printing `'A'`).**
29. **What will happen if you try to store a `string` value in a `char` variable?**
30. **Write a program that multiplies an `int` variable by a `double` variable and outputs the result. What is the data type of the result?**

34. **In C++, what is the result of adding an `int` and a `double`?**
35. **Why is it important to understand the size of each data type in C++?**
36. **Write a program that assigns a floating-point number to a `double` variable and prints it in scientific notation.**
37. **What happens if you assign a string to a `bool` variable? Explain the error or behavior.**
38. **Write a program to check if a number is odd or even using `bool` variables and output the result.**
39. **What are the limits of the `int` type in C++? How would you overcome this limitation for larger numbers?**
40. **How do you convert a `double` to an `int` in C++ and what will happen to the decimal part? Provide an example.**
